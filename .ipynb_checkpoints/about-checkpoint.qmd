::: {#hero-heading}
<br><br>

I am an Urban Planner, Data Analyst, and Smart City Enthusiast with a background in Architecture. My interests lie in data and design - using data driven policies to inform city policy. I am particularly interested in how technology and data can be effectively and equitably used to communicate and solve urban and environmental issues. I most recently worked as a Research Fellow at Econsult Solutionsâ€™ Center for Future of Cities, focused on developing a climate resilience index for major US cities. 

I am a current Master of City Planning candidate at the University of Pennsylvania (expected May 2024), with a Bachelors in Architecture from the Visvesvarya National Institute of Technology, India.
