::: {#hero-heading}

Hi! I'm Sam. I am an data analyst, urban planner, and map enthusiast. I am passionate about using my data and design skills to leverage urban data for building equitable and sustainable cities. 

I most recently worked as a data analyst at [Econsult Solutions](https://econsultsolutions.com/new-hampshires-housing-challenge-a-data-driven-approach/), developing statistical models to estimate economic and fiscal impacts of transit projects, housing, and urban green infrastructure supporting dozens of Philadelphia and nationwide agencies.

I have also worked under [Professor Akira Drake Rodriguez](https://www.akirarodriguez.com/about) to study Philadelphia schools' vulnerability to closure using spatial analysis and community engagement. 

I work mostly in R, ArcGIS and Python, as well as many transit modeling and raster analysis platforms. I've also authored numerous policy memos and reports for heads of private and city/state institutions. I use these tools and Adobe Creative Suite to tell stories through data. 

I am a Master of City Planning graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, with a Bachelors in Architecture from the Visvesvarya National Institute of Technology, India.
