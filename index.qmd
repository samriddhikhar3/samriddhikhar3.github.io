Hi! I'm Sam. I am an urban planner, spatial analyst, and map enthusiast. I am passionate about using my data and design skills to leverage urban data for building equitable and sustainable cities. 

I most recently worked as a Research Fellow at Econsult Solutions: [Center for Future of Cities](https://econsultsolutions.com/future-cities/future-cities-agenda/#:~:text=ESI%20Center%20for%20the%20Future%20of%20Cities%20brings%20together%20experts,organizations%20working%20in%20urban%20settings.), focused on developing a [climate resilience index](https://econsultsolutions.com/climate-resilience-index-2023-update/) for major US cities. I also work as a Research Assitance with [Professor Akira Drake Rodriguez](https://www.akirarodriguez.com/about) to study Philadelphia schools' vulnerability to closure using data analysis and mapping. 

I work mostly in R, ArcGIS and Python, as well as SQL for querying data and Adobe Creative Suite for design. I've written broadly for both academic and professional purposes, particularly on equity in urban techonology and planning. 

I am a current Master of City Planning student at the University of Pennsylvania (expected May 2024), with a Bachelors in Architecture from the Visvesvarya National Institute of Technology, India.
