Hi! I'm Sam. I am an urban planner, spatial analyst, and map enthusiast. I am passionate about using my data and design skills to leverage urban data for building equitable and sustainable cities. 

I most recently worked as a Research Fellow at Econsult Solutionsâ€™ Center for Future of Cities, focused on developing a climate resilience index for major US cities. 

I also work as a Research Assitance with Professor Akira Drake Rodriguez to study Philadelphia schools' vulnerability to colsure using data analysis and mapping. I am a current Master of City Planning candidate at the University of Pennsylvania (expected May 2024), with a Bachelors in Architecture from the Visvesvarya National Institute of Technology, India.
