Hi! I'm Samriddhi. I love exploring how our built environment shapes the way we live, work, and play. I am passionate about using my urban planning and geospatial analysis skills to leverage key urban data for equitable and sustainable use to improve our cities. I am an Urban Planner, Data Analyst, and Smart City Enthusiast with a background in Architecture. My interests lie in data and design - using data driven policies to inform city policy. I am particularly interested in how technology and data can be effectively and equitably used  to communicate and solve urban and environmental issues. I most recently worked as a Research Fellow at Econsult Solutionsâ€™ Center for Future of Cities, focused on developing a climate resilience index for major US cities. I also work as a Research Assitance with Professor Akira Drake Rodriguez  to study Philadelphia schools' vulnerability to colsure using data analysis and mapping. I am a current Master of City Planning candidate at the University of Pennsylvania (expected May 2024), with a Bachelors in Architecture from the Visvesvarya National Institute of Technology, India.
