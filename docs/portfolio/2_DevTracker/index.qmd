### Project Brief

![_](5.png)

Construction is one of the most polluting industries in Philadelphia. The Office of Sustainability has been actively addressing this concern by collaborating with the Department of Licenses and Inspections. Together, they aim to introduce sustainable practices and reduce the environmental impact of construction in the city.

Neighborhoods in Philadelphia exhibit varying historical and current development trends. Recognizing these differences is crucial for proposing context-based Green Building recommendations for future development. By understanding the unique characteristics of different neighborhoods, the Office of Sustainability can create targeted and effective recommendations which vary from neighborhood to neighborhood.

This approach ensures that the proposed green building standards not only contribute to environmental conservation but also align with the specific needs and developmental nuances of each community. In doing so, this analysis aims to foster a more sustainable and resilient urban environment for the residents of Philadelphia.

Our application can be used to propose neighborhood specific green building recommendations and industry specific strategies and also to develop targeted Green Building Training Programs for contractors in Philadelphia that are working on development projects.
