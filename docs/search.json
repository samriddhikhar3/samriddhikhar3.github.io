    "title": "Exploring Digital Equity Through Cell Tower Data",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Project Brief\nAs the world continually modernizes, the “digital divide” - a term describing disparity in access to technology - persists, placing certain groups at a distinct disadvantage. In particular, the recent global pandemic shed light on the inequality of digital access worldwide. Due to a substantial reliance on the internet for communication by a significant portion of the global population, individuals without access experienced even greater social and mental burdens during the pandemic. As a result, our team sought out to understand the varied digital equity landscape at the international, federal, and state levels through geospatial data analysis. In our project, we followed a set of guiding questions:\n\nWhat international metrics may inform digital equity in developed vs developing countries?\nIs there equitable access of ICT technology across the United States?\nHow does the digital divide persist in rural vs urban areas at various scales?\n\nA large part of the conversation about resolving the digital divide focuses on Information and Communications Technology (ICT) as well as telecommunications availability. As a result, we selected our main data source - a cell tower location database provided by OpenCellID. Managed by Unwired Labs, this collaborative initiative aggregates data from registered contributors.\n\n\nExploratory Analysis\nIn our exploratory analysis, we created over a dozen data visualizations to evaluate cell tower data at the international, federal, and state level. These visualizations condensed over 200 million data points into comprehensible and actionable information. Here are a few visualizations that I contributed to the section I lead, the international cell tower coverage section:\n\n\n\nEvery cell tower in the world, mapped using OpenCellID data.\n\n\nThis map is a product of big data wrangling and data shading/condensing, and provides an overarching understanding of the cell tower coverage across different countries and regions.\n\n\nCode\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport altair as alt\nimport geopandas as gpd\n\ncolor_key = {\"GSM\": \"#707390\",\n             \"CDMA\": \"#93b7be\",\n             \"UMTS\": \"#e0ca3c\",\n             \"LTE\": \"#b59ab8\",\n             \"NR\": \"#048a81\"}\n\ngdp_per_capita = pd.read_csv(\"./Data/gdp_per_capita.csv\") #data from world bank\ngdp_per_capita = gdp_per_capita[['Country Name', '2021 [YR2021]']]\ngdp_per_capita = gdp_per_capita.rename(columns={\n    'Country Name': 'country',\n    '2021 [YR2021]': 'gdp_per_capita'\n})\ngdp_per_capita = gdp_per_capita.dropna(subset=['country'])\npopulation = pd.read_csv(\"./data/population.csv\") #data from world bank\npopulation = population[['Country Name', '2021 [YR2021]']]\npopulation = population.rename(columns={\n    'Country Name': 'country',\n    '2021 [YR2021]': 'population'\n})\npopulation = population.dropna(subset=['country'])\ngpc_pop = population.merge(gdp_per_capita, how='left', on='country')\n\ncountries_towers = pd.read_csv(\"./Data/international_cell_towers.csv\")\n\nmerge = countries_towers.merge(gpc_pop, how='left', on='country')\nmerge.rename(columns={'UMES': 'UMTS'}, inplace=True)\n\ntower_types = ['UMTS', 'GSM', 'LTE', 'CDMA']\nmerge['dominant_tower_type'] = merge[tower_types].idxmax(axis=1)\n\nmerge['cell_towers'] = pd.to_numeric(merge['cell_towers'], errors='coerce')\nmerge['population'] = pd.to_numeric(merge['population'], errors='coerce')\nmerge['gdp_per_capita'] = pd.to_numeric(merge['gdp_per_capita'], errors='coerce')\nmerge['ctw_per_capita'] = merge['cell_towers'] / merge['population']\n\nmerge_df = pd.DataFrame(merge)\nmerge_df = merge_df.dropna()\n\nbrush = alt.selection_interval(encodings=['x'])\nclick = alt.selection_point(encodings=['color'])\n\npoints = alt.Chart(merge_df).mark_circle().encode(\n    alt.X(\"gdp_per_capita:Q\",\n    scale=alt.Scale(zero=False, type=\"log\"),\n    title=\"Log GDP per Capita\"),\n    alt.Y(\"ctw_per_capita:Q\",\n    scale=alt.Scale(type=\"log\"),\n    title=\"Log Cell Towers per Capita\"),\n    size=alt.Size(\"population:Q\", title=\"Population\"),\n    color=alt.condition(brush,\n    alt.Color(\"dominant_tower_type:N\",\n    title=\"Dominant Tower Type\",\n    scale=alt.Scale(domain=list(color_key.keys()), \n    range=list(color_key.values())),), alt.value('grey')),\n    tooltip=\"country\",\n).properties(width=500,\nheight=350).add_selection(brush).transform_filter(\n    click\n)\n\nbars = alt.Chart(merge_df).mark_bar().encode(\n    x='count()',\n    y=alt.Y(\"dominant_tower_type:N\", title=\"Dominant Tower Type\"),\n    color=alt.condition(brush,\n    alt.Color(\"dominant_tower_type:N\",\n    title=\"Dominant Tower Type\"),\n    alt.value('lightgray')),\n).transform_filter(brush).properties(width=550).add_params(\n    click\n)\n\n# Combine charts\nalt.vconcat(points, bars, title=\"World Cell Tower Coverage\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this interactive chart, we can analyze different countries’ advancement in cell tower technology with respect to their population, GDP per capita, and cell tower per capita. Interact with the chart by selecting sections of the scatter plot to see counts of countries’ dominant tower types (only GSM, LTE, UMTS), or click on each of the dominant tower types on the bar plot to see only countries of that tower type. The size of the countries’ populations are also represented through the size of the points, which you can hover over to find the country name. Note that GDP per capita and cell towers per capita on the scatter plot have been logged. Click the arrow above the charts to unfold the code.\nThe accompanying chart reveals not only a correlation between the logarithmic representation of cell towers per capita and GDP per capita but also a discernible trend. Less developed countries, as indicated by the GDP per capita metric, tend to exhibit a dominance of less advanced tower types such as GSM (2G), in contrast to more developed countries that are more inclined to have UMTS (3G) or LTE (4G) as the type most prevalent.\n\n\nProject Outcomes\nThis project and its code has been posted on the MUSA 550 Fall 2023 website created by my instructor, Dr. Nick Hand. Find the full post of the Exploring Digital Equity project here.\nIn conclusion, our project successfully explored digital equity through cell tower data at multiple levels. The analysis not only provided a global understanding of technology distribution but also examined into the complexity of cellular landscapes in the United States and the challenges faced by rural areas. The project’s use of geospatial data science and analysis showcased the power of data science in uncovering patterns, correlations, and disparities related to cellular infrastructure. Ultimately, the findings contribute valuable insights to the ongoing conversation about bridging the digital divide and ensuring equitable access to technology on a global scale.\n\n\nData Sources\n\nOpenCellID\nWorld Bank\nFederal Communications Commission (FCC)\nCenter For Rural Pennsylvania\nPennsylvania Spatial Data Access\nUnited States Census Bureau\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Project Brief\nIn this project, my team and I had the opportunity to explore an urban issue and tackle it using urban sensors we designed and created ourselves. A few key issues we identified and wanted to address:\n\nMany kids are playing on tattered playgrounds or abandoned parking lots on the sides of public schools.\nUpdating playground equipment can cost $8,000-$50,000.\nThere is no substantial line item in the Philadelphia School District’s annual budget to support upgrading playgrounds.\nCurrently, a piecemeal system of public-private partnerships funds the handful of schoolyard-improvement projects\n1 in 5 youth in Philadelphia, the majority of whom are black or Hispanic, are overweight or obese. 70% in North Philly which is nearly double the obesity and overweight rate for youth in the United States. (Source)\n\nIn response to these findings, we prototyped a suite of interactive playground installations that we believe would not only support physical activity and learning, but could work as a powerful pilot program for transforming underserved schools and communities across the city of Philadelphia: DigiPlay.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy team and I with our final prototypes. From left to right: Gustell Preston, Stephanie Cheng, Shreya Bansal, Noah Johnson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn creating our prototypes, we also used laser cutting, soldering, and countless different wiring and coding configurations to achieve our desired digital playground installations.\n\n\n\n\nDigiPlay works to solve this challenge of inequitable access to play by transforming dull play spacing into interactive, digitally-latent ones that encourage movement and serve as another avenue for learning and education in schools. Our solution has three major components, outfitting schools that already had some play equipment with DigiPlay sensors, Creating digital experiences for schools with no play equipment, and layering on educational components of the playground. Additionally, our solution is cost effective for schools to adopt, with 1-3 interactive installations on a playground costing about ~$300 to install and another ~$100 to maintain on a yearly basis. Thus, DigiPlay is an inexpensive way to explore the transformative potential of embedded technologies in our built environment.\nThis project is a culmination of the skills gained in the Spring 2023 Sensing the City class taught by my instructor and advisor, Professor Allison Lassiter. Find the full post of the DigiPlay project on that website here.\n\n\nExploratory Analysis\nIn our exploratory analysis, particularly when identifying which schools to employ this project, we looked at the proximity of playgrounds to schools and environmental features. To test our pilot, we chose a school closer to base called the Albert M. Greenfield playground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Outcomes\nIn total, we designed and prototyped four digital playground installations:\n\nHeart-rate sensor wall module and Musical jungle gym\n\n\n\nInteractive playfield\n\n\n\n\nPrototype testing\n\n\nThe DigiPlay full project and presentation slidedeck include more information, such as technical specifications, wiring and Arduino code tutorials, project phasing and scaling, etc.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Project Brief\nNJ Transit is the primary transit authority in the state of New Jersey and has control over its rail systems and tracks. This project looks into the causes of delays and assumes that most of them might be attributed to climatic conditions. Particularly under very hot and very cold conditions, railways are prone to damages, which we hypothesized will cause more consequential delays that run for a longer period of time, sometimes even causing cancellations. This project explores how addressing and predicting for these delays can help select those tracks that need more maintenance and checks.\nWe created a government-facing website for NJ transit authority to predict where most train delays will happen to schedule checking, remodeling and upgradation of train tracks in those segments. We hope our forecast models will allow NJ Transit to optimize repair funding more efficiently and prevent delays.\nThis analysis uses a simple Machine Learning model based on a linear regression, while employing a space-time panel with variables such as station, time, time lag, etc. We see great uses of a similar model in other cities like New York and Philadelphia to help predict for SEPTA and MTA delays to scale.\n\n\nExploratory Analysis\n\n\n\nWe began our analysis by looking at where and by how long train delays occur.\n\n\nIn our exploratory analysis, we conducted various GIS analyses and correlation tests to determine how best to build our prediction model. Our approach focuses on climatic conditions and how they affect delay time. Variables used include wind, temperature, visibility, precipitation, etc.\n\n\n\nAs climate change continues to worsen, railway tracks are more often in need of repair.\n\n\nWe created three regression models with different variables, and found our third regression most accurate:\n\n\n \nRegression 3 &lt;- lm (delay_minutes ~\nstation + hour + day of the week\n+ Temperature + Precipitation +\nVisibility + Wind_Speed + lagHour\n+ lag2Hours +lag3Hours +lag12Hours\n+ lag1day + holidayLag + holiday\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, we believe our project is a proactive approach to track maintenance through the lens of delay consequences. It is cost reducing, and can increase resilience and customer satisfaction.\n\n\nProject Outcomes\nThe project outcome and use case for this analysis was a prototype website to serve NJ Transit in making decisions on rail upgrades.

    "text": "In this project, I had the opportunity to explore Boston’s rapid transit system, known as the “T,” as a vital component of the city’s public transportation network. Using machine learning models and optimizing accuracy and minimizing errors, I used data analysis to make policy recommendations and aswer questions like do households value transit-rich neighborhoods compared to others? How certain can planners be about data-driven conclusions given some spatial biases?\nThis policy brief attempts to address the value and citzen settlement patterns of transit-rich neighborhoods, comparing them to the city at large. It makes extensive use of the American Community Survey data, along with publically available information on the MBTA’s rapid transit routes and stops."

    "title": "Predicting Development Changes in Philadelphia to Create Targeted Green Building Policy",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Project Brief\nConstruction is one of the most polluting industries in Philadelphia. The Office of Sustainability has been actively addressing this concern by collaborating with the Department of Licenses and Inspections. Together, they aim to introduce sustainable practices and reduce the environmental impact of construction in the city.\nNeighborhoods in Philadelphia exhibit varying historical and current development trends. Recognizing these differences is crucial for proposing context-based Green Building recommendations for future development. For instance, areas with historical significance may require preservation-focused green guidelines, while rapidly developing neighborhoods may benefit from stricter regulations for green building and incentives for sustainable urban planning.\nBy understanding the unique characteristics of different neighborhoods, the Office of Sustainability can create targeted and effective recommendations which vary from neighborhood to neighborhood. This approach ensures that the proposed green building standards not only contribute to environmental conservation but also align with the specific needs and developmental nuances of each community. In doing so, this analysis aims to foster a more sustainable and resilient urban environment for the residents of Philadelphia. As the first step, this project aims to utilize historic data for construction to predict the areas where construction is most likely to occur.\n\n\nExploratory Analysis\n\n\n\nWe began our analysis by looking at where construction and demolition permits were being introduced.\n\n\nIn our exploratory analysis, we conducted various GIS analyses and correlation tests to determine how best to build our prediction model. Our approach focuses on TEXT.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Project Brief\nSan Francisco grapples with persistent challenges in its parking landscape, characterized by limited availability and high demand. The city’s densely populated neighborhoods often experience a shortage of parking spaces. These shortges are also reflective of certain social and demographic patterns in the city, as we have uncovered in this research.\nIn response to these difficulties, the use of parking apps has gained prominence, offering real-time information on available spaces and facilitating a more efficient navigation of the city’s intricate parking network. Increasing the efficiency of such apps could be a significant use case of this analysis.\nMoreover, the city has embraced innovative approaches to address parking issues. The implementation of smart parking meters, capable of adjusting rates based on demand and time of day, represents one such effort. Data from these parking meters has been included in our analysis. Additionally, there has been a push towards dynamic pricing strategies to incentivize turnover and optimize the utilization of parking spaces. These strategies can be more equitably informed if they take in to account how these policies are place within the larger sociodemographic framework of the city. As San Francisco continues to grapple with the complexities of urban parking, these trends underscore a broader shift towards sustainable transportation options and technological solutions in managing the city’s parking challenges.\n\n\n\n Back to top"
