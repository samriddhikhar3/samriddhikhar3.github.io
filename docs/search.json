Using machine learning models and optimizing accuracy and minimizing errors, I used data analysis to make policy recommendations and aswer questions like do households value transit-rich neighborhoods compared to others? How certain can planners be about data-driven conclusions given some spatial biases?\nThis policy brief attempts to address the value and citzen settlement patterns of transit-rich neighborhoods, comparing them to the city at large.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Project Brief\nFor interactive visualizations, visit the full analysis.\nSan Francisco grapples with persistent challenges in its parking landscape, characterized by limited availability and high demand. The city’s densely populated neighborhoods often experience a shortage of parking spaces. These shortges are also reflective of certain social and demographic patterns in the city, as we have uncovered in this research.\nIn response to these difficulties, the use of parking apps has gained prominence, offering real-time information on available spaces and facilitating a more efficient navigation of the city’s intricate parking network. Increasing the efficiency of such apps could be a significant use case of this analysis.\nThis project aims to utilize San Francisco’s open parking data to map and visualize parking availability, occupancy, and clustering trends within the city over the recent months/years and predict demand for parking across the city. The project process is outlined as:\n\n1. Exploratory Analysis & Storytelling\nWe wanted to frame the parking demand and supply trends within the larger framework of demographic and social patterns in San Francisco. Using the census data (and possibly other sources with neighborhood-level information), we expected to identify associations between high and low-demand areas with variables such as race, income, and employment.\n\n\n\nParking Meter Desnity.\n\n\n\n\n2. Main Analysis\nBy conducting spatial joins for the data collected from various sets, we aimed to present the patterns of occupancy and use over time for the given parking spaces. We also ran correlation tests to see factors influencing parking.\n\n\n\nCensus Data Collection through APIs.\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation Matrix.\n\n\n\n\n3. Predicitive Modeling\nUsing a Random Forest Model, we predict areas with high demand for parking using the factors defined in the previous step.\n\n\n\nRandom Forest Model. The extremely high R squared value could be indicative of an overfit model, to mitigate this we ran iterative tests of generalizability on the data.\n\n\n\n\n4. Data Visualization\nWe wanted to include interactive visualizations about parking demands and street networks comparing different San Francisco neighborhoods."

Next, we identified influential factors affecting flooding based on a thorough review of relevant literature. Utilizing the chosen factors, we developed a Generalized Linear Regression (GLM) model, training it on the Calgary dataset and subsequently testing it on Boise. Despite the model’s inclination to assign disproportionate weight to specific factors, it provided compelling insights. Throughout this analytical process, we prioritized effective data visualization techniques to enhance the accessibility and interpretability of our findings within the context of flood prediction dynamics."

    "text": "Project Brief\n\n\n\nDeveloped Fight Kit was published as a zine.\n\n\nMy current work at Penn Praxis includes creating a counter-narrative to the opacity of the School District of Philadelphia’s (SDP) facilities planning process. The SDP uses school statistics such as enrollment to determine school closure. The effect of these metric-driven decision-making processes is racially and socio-economically defined school closures. To predict which schools might be most vulnerable to closure, we utilize the SDP’s metrics, neighborhood demographic data, data from community stakeholder meetings, and data from sensors at network schools (to determine AQI, pollutants, and temperature) to support activists in mobilizing communities to protect their neighborhood schools. We create a prioritized action plan, which includes findings from geostatistical models based on the vulnerability assessment, to help policymakers understand the school conditions. We also have the opportunity to engage directly with the students through a Youth and Parent Summit organized by numerous West Philadelphia-based organizations connected to PennPraxis.\nWith the school vulnerability map, local governments are able to identify schools at risk preemptively and plan for the placement of students afterward and the reuse of school buildings.\nI furthered my analysis through a studio project titled “School Community Planning for Sayre High School, Philadelphia.”\nThrough student engagement and data analysis, my team and I developed a Resource Dashboard for members of the Sayre Community. The dashboard contains interactive resources for students and teachers to find professional development tools and funding sources.\n\n\n\nStudent Engagement\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanning Process\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess"

Citizen groups led by advocates, architects and planners were quick to mobilize and protest this mass deforestation while also developing an alternate site proposal, one that does not require massive felling of trees, is better connected to the transit network and would not lead to evictions and displacement of residents.\nMy team and I worked on the site proposal using predictive spatial analysis using raster data (Landsat), Google Earth Engine and remote sensing in ArcGIS and Python.\nUsing our analysis we were able to justify the alternate site and facilitate sustainable and equitable urban development.\n\n\n\nTimeline of movement.\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Proposal.\n\n\nThis map illustrates two proposals for the site of construction for an Inter Modal Station. The original proposal at Ajni was administered through a top-down approach by the state government. Citizens were alerted of the mass deforestation the project would cause and raised their concerns to me and my team.
