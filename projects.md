#### [Public Schools as Equity Infrastructure: Vulnerabilty Index](/projects/khare_samriddhi_assignment2.html){:target="_blank"}

My role was to develop and refine a vulnerability to closure index for Philadelphia’s schools for local government and school districts to inform their facilities planning process. We did a comprehensive study to make our index as accurate as possible, using school enrollment statistics and demographics. We expanded our study by including census and neighborhood-level data into our work, such as gun violence and income levels. Makayla was responsible for taking this data, along with previously existing research, and compiling it into a usable and easy to understand zine, for the benefit of students, parents, or concerned citizens. We also had the opportunity to engage directly with the students through a Youth and Parent Summit organized by numerous West Philadelphia-based organizations connected to PennPraxis.

#### [Transit Oriented Development: Analyzing Boston’s Rapid Transit](/projects/khare_samriddhi_assignment2.html){:target="_blank"}

This policy brief attempts to address the value and citzen settlement patterns of transit-rich neighborhoods, comparing them to the city at large. It makes extensive use of the American Community Survey data, along with publically available information on the MBTA’s rapid transit routes and stops.
