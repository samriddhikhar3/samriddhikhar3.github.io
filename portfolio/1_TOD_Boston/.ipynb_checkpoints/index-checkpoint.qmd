### Project Brief

In this project, I had the opportunity to explore Boston’s rapid transit system, known as the “T,” as a vital component of the city’s public transportation network. Using machine learning models and optimizing accuracy and minimizing errors, I used data analysis to make policy recommendations and aswer questions like do households value transit-rich neighborhoods compared to others? How certain can planners be about data-driven conclusions given some spatial biases?

This policy brief attempts to address the value and citzen settlement patterns of transit-rich neighborhoods, comparing them to the city at large. It makes extensive use of the American Community Survey data, along with publically available information on the MBTA’s rapid transit routes and stops.

DigiPlay works to solve this challenge of inequitable access to play by transforming dull play spacing into interactive, digitally-latent ones that encourage movement and serve as another avenue for learning and education in schools. Our solution has three major components, outfitting schools that already had some play equipment with DigiPlay sensors, Creating digital experiences for schools with no play equipment, and layering on educational components of the playground. Additionally, our solution is cost effective for schools to adopt, with 1-3 interactive installations on a playground costing about ~$300 to install and another ~$100 to maintain on a yearly basis. Thus, DigiPlay is an inexpensive way to explore the transformative potential of embedded technologies in our built environment.

This project is a culmination of the skills gained in the Spring 2023 [Sensing the City](https://www.sensingthecity.com/) class taught by my instructor and advisor, Professor Allison Lassiter.

### Exploratory Analysis

In our exploratory analysis, particularly when identifying which schools to employ this project, we looked at the proximity of playgrounds to schools and environmental features. To test our pilot, we chose a school closer to base called the Albert M. Greenfield playground.

### Project Outcomes

In total, we designed and prototyped four digital playground installations:


#### Heart-rate sensor wall module and Musical jungle gym
