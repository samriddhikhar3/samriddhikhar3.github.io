### Project Brief

My role was to develop and refine a vulnerability to closure index for Philadelphia’s schools for local government and school districts to inform their facilities planning process. We did a comprehensive study to make our index as accurate as possible, using school enrollment statistics and demographics. We expanded our study by including census and neighborhood-level data into our work, such as gun violence and income levels. Makayla was responsible for taking this data, along with previously existing research, and compiling it into a usable and easy to understand zine, for the benefit of students, parents, or concerned citizens. We also had the opportunity to engage directly with the students through a Youth and Parent Summit organized by numerous West Philadelphia-based organizations connected to PennPraxis.  

My current work at Penn Praxis includes creating a counter-narrative to the opacity of the School District of Philadelphia's (SDP) facilities planning process. The SDP uses school statistics such as enrollment to determine school closure. The effect of these metric-driven decision-making processes has been racially and socio-economically defined school closures. To predict which schools might be most vulnerable to closure, we utilized the SDP’s metrics, neighborhood demographic data, data from community stakeholder meetings, and data from sensors at network schools (to determine AQI, pollutants, and temperature) to support activists in mobilizing communities to protect their neighborhood schools. We created a prioritized action plan, which included findings from geostatistical 
models based on the vulnerability assessment, to help policymakers understand the school conditions. 

With the school vulnerability map, local governments were able to identify schools at risk preemptively 
and plan for the placement of students afterward and the reuse of school buildings.
