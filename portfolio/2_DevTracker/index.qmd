### Project Brief

Construction is one of the most polluting industries in Philadelphia. The Office of Sustainability has been actively addressing this concern by collaborating with the Department of Licenses and Inspections. Together, they aim to introduce sustainable practices and reduce the environmental impact of construction in the city.

Neighborhoods in Philadelphia exhibit varying historical and current development trends. Recognizing these differences is crucial for proposing context-based Green Building recommendations for future development. For instance, areas with historical significance may require preservation-focused green guidelines, while rapidly developing neighborhoods may benefit from stricter regulations for green building and incentives for sustainable urban planning.

By understanding the unique characteristics of different neighborhoods, the Office of Sustainability can create targeted and effective recommendations which vary from neighborhood to neighborhood. This approach ensures that the proposed green building standards not only contribute to environmental conservation but also align with the specific needs and developmental nuances of each community. In doing so, this analysis aims to foster a more sustainable and resilient urban environment for the residents of Philadelphia. As the first step, this project aims to utilize historic data for construction to predict the areas where construction is most likely to occur. 

### Exploratory Analysis

In our exploratory analysis, we conducted various GIS analyses and correlation tests to determine how best to build our prediction model. Our approach focuses on TEXT. Variables used include TEXT

In conclusion, TEXT

### Project Outcomes

To propose neighborhood specific green building recommendations and industry specific strategies.To develop targeted Green Building Training Programs for contractors in Philadelphia that are working on these development projects. See more in the presentation video, wireframing website prototype, and full analysis.
